This file is used to record the results of running the various benchmarks in this repo. If you'd like to add one, please record the test conditions - emulator or platform used, version of BASIC, and whether or not a math pack is being used. If you use a new math pack, please run the tests using Atari's math pack as well (if possible) for comparison purposes. Send in those pull requests!
